# Titanic Survival Predictor 🚢

The **Titanic Survival Predictor** is a machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics, such as age, sex, class, and other features. This project demonstrates the use of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and classification algorithms.

---

## 📋 Features
- Predict survival outcomes based on passenger data.
- Includes data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
- Utilizes machine learning models for classification.
- Detailed analysis of model performance with accuracy metrics.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival-predictor.git
   cd titanic-survival-predictor

# Set up the environment: Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset: Download the Titanic dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory.

# 🚀 Usage
Run the notebook: Open and execute the titanic_survival_predictor.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction pipeline.

Run the script: For CLI usage, execute:
python predict_titanic.py --input "path_to_input_data.csv"

Test the Model: The model will output predictions indicating survival (1) or not (0).

# 📊 Results
The model achieves an accuracy of approximately X% (replace with actual results after training). Further optimizations can be performed for better results.
